I am a mathematician interested in combinatorial optimization and 
machine learning. Since February 2020 
  I am a Post-doc fellow in <a href="http://www.i3s.unice.fr/">i3S</a>, Sophia Antipolis. Between 2014 and 2019 I was a researcher in the Mathematical
  & Algorithmic Sciences Lab from Paris Research Center, Huawei France. I obtained my Ph.D in Mathematics in 2015 from
 the University of Seville. I received an M.Sc. in Advanced Mathematics in 2012 and an B.Sc. in Mathematics in 2010 
from the University of Seville.
